# My-Movies and Scoreboard

## My-Movies

This PHP-based application is a stripped down, minimalistic copy of IMDB.com. Along with the data from imdb.com, this application is used in Percona trainings to challenge students to improve performance of the application by making schema changes as taught in the classes.

## Scoreboard

This NodeJS application supports My-Movies in a Percona classroom to provide a 'scoreboard' of how well each team/member is progressing during the challenge.
